Certainly!

### **(a) Definition & Usage**
The Croatian proverb **"Krsti vuka, a vuk u goru"** means that despite efforts to change someone’s nature (through words, punishment, or persuasion), they will remain the same. It is used when someone pretends to reform or promises to change but quickly reverts to their old ways.

**Adequate situation example:**
A thief promises to stop stealing, but soon after, he steals again. Someone might say this proverb to express skepticism about his supposed change.
